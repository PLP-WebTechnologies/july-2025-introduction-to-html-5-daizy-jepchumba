        <section id="composting">
            <h2>Composting: Nature's Recycling System</h2>
            <p>Composting transforms kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil amendment. This natural process reduces waste while providing your plants with essential nutrients.</p>
            
            <h3>What to Compost</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fruit and vegetable scraps</li>
                <li>Coffee grounds and tea bags</li>
                <li>Eggshells</li>
                <li>Fallen leaves and grass clippings</li>
                <li>Paper and cardboard (shredded)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Not to Compost</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Meat, fish, or dairy products</li>
                <li>Oils or fats</li>
                <li>Pet waste</li>
                <li>Diseased plants</li>
                <li>Weeds with seeds</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Maintain a balance of "green" materials (nitrogen-rich) and "brown" materials (carbon-rich) for optimal decomposition.</p>

        <section id="water-conservation">
            <h2>Water Conservation Strategies</h2>
            <p>Efficient water use is crucial for sustainable gardening. These methods help conserve this precious resource while keeping your plants healthy.</p>

            <h3>Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
            <p>Collect rainwater in barrels or containers to use during dry periods. This free water source is naturally soft and free of chemicals found in tap water.</p>

            <h3>Mulching</h3>
            <p>Apply a layer of organic mulch around plants to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Retain soil moisture</li>
                <li>Suppress weeds</li>
                <li>Regulate soil temperature</li>
                <li>Improve soil structure as it decomposes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Drip Irrigation</h3>
            <p>Drip irrigation systems deliver water directly to plant roots, reducing evaporation and ensuring efficient water use. This method can reduce water consumption by up to 50% compared to traditional sprinklers.</p>

                <li>Apply neem oil or insecticidal soap for targeted treatment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Soil Health</h3>
            <p>Healthy soil is the foundation of sustainable gardening. Build soil health through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding compost regularly</li>
                <li>Minimizing soil disturbance</li>
